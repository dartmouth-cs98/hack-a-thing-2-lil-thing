## Raspberry Pi
I used the raspberry pi starter kit and played around with turning LED lights on and playing 
sounds by pressing buttons. blink_LED.py just blinks an LED light every other second. button_LED.py
lights up an LED when a button is clicked. Finally, sound_maker.py in the gpio-music-box directory 
makes four buttons play specific sounds. I learned these from the canakit tutorial pamphlet and raspberry pi 
project tutorials https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/gpio-music-box.
Also played around with inputs/outputs, such as motion sensors and motors.

## What I learned
This was my first time using Raspberry pi. I hadn't really worked with hardware or circuits 
before so it took me a little while to figure out how to configure everything.

## Inspiration
My group has definitely been thinking about using hardware for our project, so this was a 
good taste tester.

## What didn't work
The kit explicitly said that the SD card would have the required software preinstalled. For 
some reason it hadn't been installed. Because of this, the computer wasn't booting up. 
It took me a while to figure out that the SD card was empty 
and that I needed to go and download/import the software onto the SD card. Also, my breadboard 
was kind of small, which limited the amount I could do with it.
