## Raspberry Pi
I used the raspberry pi starter kit and played around with turning lights on and playing 
sounds by pressing buttons. 

## What I learned
This was my first time using Raspberry pi. I hadn't really worked with hardware or circuits 
before so it took me a little while to figure out how to configure everything.

## Inspiration
My group has definitely been thinking about using hardware for our project, so this was a 
good taste tester.

## What didn't work
The kit explicitly said that the SD card would have the required software preinstalled. For 
some reason it hadn't been installed. It took me a while to figure out that the SD card was empty 
and then go and download what I needed. I also didn't have any resistors on me, so I was limited 
in what I could build.
